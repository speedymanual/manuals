					 Bombardier/Can-Am has been making youth ATVs since 2002. In that year they released 2-stroke 50 and 90 models, and also a 4-stroke 90 model.
					 The 50 was made until 2006, and in 2007 a 4-stroke 70 model was added to the lineup, and is still made today.
					 In 2008 the top of the line DS90X was added, featuring advanced features for a mini ATV including plush suspension and sporty styling. 
					 While they haven't received updates, the DS90 and DS90X are still available year after year.
